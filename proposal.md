# Car Race Dodge

## Repository
[Car Race Dodge GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/HellenSanchez/pfda_finalproject_HellenSanchez.git)

## Description
A racing game in Python where the player controls a car that moves left and right to avoid cones falling from the top of the screen.

## Features
- Feature 1
  - Car Control: The player can move the car horizontally to dodge obstacles.
  - Implemented using Pygame to detect keyboard inputs and update the car's position.
- Feature 2
  - Dynamic Obstacles: Cones falling from the top at different speeds.
  - Implemented using lists of obstacles and updating their positions each frame.
- Feature 3
  - Scoring System: Each time the car successfully avoids cones, the score increases and is displayed above the cones.
  - Implemented using a score variable that is rendered on the screen.
- Feature 4
  - Collision and Restart: If the car hits a cone, the game restarts automatically.
  - Under consideration: Display a, "Oops! You hit a cone" message with "Try Again" or "Quit" options instead of restarting automatically.
 
## Challenges
- Learn to use Pygame for animation and keyboard input handling.
- Learn to create an efficient collision detection system between the car and cones.
- Learn to implement a scoring system that updates and displays in real-time.
- Research/learn to design the car and cone graphics using pixel art (two ideas: create them in another art program and export them as PNG files, or draw directly in the code.)

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A fully functional game with smooth movement, accurate collision detection, visible scoring, and a "Oops! You hit a cone" message with "Try Again" or "Quit" buttons.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A game where the car can move left and right, cones fall, the score increases when avoiding cones, and the game restarts automatically upon collision.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1: Create the public GitHub repository.
  2. Goal 2: Create the 'Proposal.md' file and write the full proposal.

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1: Implement car movement left and right.
  2. Goal 2: Design car and cone graphics (decide whether to create in another art program as PNGs or draw directly in code) and initialize the game screen to display them.

- Week 3
  1. Goal 1: Implement cones falling from the top and collision detection.
  2. Goal 2: Implement scoring system that updates in real-time and display score on the screen.

- Week 4 (Final)
  1. Goal 1: Add game restart behavior and finalize the "Oops! You hit a cone" message (if decided to implement.)
  2. Goal 2: Polish visuals and animations, finalize features, test the game, record the demonstration video, update the README.md, and submit the project on GitHub and eLearning.
